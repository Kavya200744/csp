            <h1>Washing Hands</h1>
            <p>Most germs are spread through hand contact. Regularly washing hands will prevent your child and others from getting sick.

                Encourage your child to wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds:
                <ul>
                    <li>when their hands look dirty</li>
                    <li>before eating or making food</li>
                    <li>after touching raw meats, including chicken and beef</li>
                    <li>after touching any body fluids like blood, urine (wee) or vomit (sick)</li>
                    <li>after touching animals (including cats and dogs)</li>
                    <li>after blowing their nose, sneezing or coughing</li>
                    <li>going to the toilet</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Showering and bathing</h1>
            <p>Children need regular baths or showers. You can include a bath or shower at the end of the day as part of their bedtime routine. Your childâ€™s hair should be washed 1 to 2 times a week. If their hair is very oily, it might need washing more often.

                Make sure your child washes all of their body, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>under their arms</li>
                    <li>their genital area</li>
                    <li>their anal area</li>
                    <li>between their toes</li>
                </ul>
                Make sure that their body is thoroughly dry before they get dressed.

            <h1>Teeth hygiene</h1>
            <p>Good dental hygiene is about more than just pearly white teeth. Caring for your teeth and gums is a smart way to prevent gum diseases and cavities.

                Brush at least twice a day for 2 minutes. Aim to brush after you wake up and before bed. If you can, brush after every meal, too. Floss between your teeth daily, and ask your dentist about using an antibacterial mouthwash.
                
                These two steps can help prevent tooth decay and eliminate pockets where bacteria and germs can build up.</p>

            <h1>Nail hygiene</h1>
            <p>Trim your nails regularly to keep them short and clean. Brush under them with a nail brush or washcloth to rinse away buildup, dirt, and germs.

                Tidying your nails helps you prevent spreading germs into your mouth and other body openings. You should also avoid biting your nails.</p>
